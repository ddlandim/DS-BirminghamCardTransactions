# DS-BirminghamCardTransactions
Data Science work to get data insights from Birmingham City Council - Purchase Card Transactions

In this dataset you have a collection of purchase card transactions for the Birmingham City Council. https://data.birmingham.gov.uk/organization/birmingham-city-council. This is a historical dataset, you’re able to perform any of the following tasks:

(Clustering) Discovering profiles (whether the case) or unusual transactions (anomalies detection) ...
(Forecasting) Try to guess future transactional behaviors. For instance, what would be the next purchase? Expenditures forecasting? ...
(Creativity) State a problem.

It’s up to you defining the time window in which your analysis will take place.

To do so, we suggest you create a notebook, like Jupyter (if you use python) or a Rmarkdown report (in case you use R) and make it available.
 
Hint to success in your quest: Develop and state clear of the data science process you'll perform over the dataset and highlight important aspects you might consider affordable to discuss over. Use the mindset of a business and curious consultant.
